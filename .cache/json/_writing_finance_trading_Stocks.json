Units of stock are called shares.</li>\n<li>Outstanding shares: a company's stock currently held by all its shareholders, including share blocks held by institutional investors and restricted shares owned by people in the company. Called \"capital stock\" on the balance sheet.</li>\n<li>Separation of ownership and control: Idea that shareholders don't really own a part of the corporation, they just own shares. You couldn't walk out with an office chair simply because you are a shareholder. </li>\n<li>Retained Earnings: earnings reinvested back into the company rather than given to the shareholders (in the form of dividends).</li>\n<li>Common stock: can vote during shareholders meetings and receive dividends</li>\n<li>Preferred stocks: no voting rights but have a higher claim on assets and earnings (this is what say a CEO would receive). Also receive dividends before the common stock.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Notes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Two main types of stock: common and preferred. </li>\n<li>Have historically out preformed most other investments over the long run.</li>\n<li>Corporations are treated as people by the law. They own assets, can be sued, file taxes, etc. </li>\n<li>Companies issue shares in the primary market and people buy them from each other in the secondary market.</li>\n<li>Bondholders are entitled to interest payments and repayment of principal. Creditors get priority in the case of a bankruptcy. Much safer investment than stocks but less rewarding.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"slug":"/writing/finance/trading/Stocks","date":"2021-02-01"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/writing/finance/trading/Stocks"}}
