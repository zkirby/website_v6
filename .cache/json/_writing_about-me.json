{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h1>Hello There.</h1>\n<h3>Preface</h3>\n<p class=\"preface\">\nI'm often drawn to the 'about' sections of people's websites. The web is naturally impersonal relative to face to face communication and there's something intriguing about getting to know people in general. Maybe it's just some subcouncious stalker tendency I've developed - but as a child of the social media age it's probably only natural. So, dear stalker, I wanted to carve out a nice section of my own little slice of the world wide web to just sit down and talk a little more about myself. If that's something you are interested in - please read on. Otherwise, no harm no foul, maybe we'll meet in person one day for a much less one-sided introduction.\n</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Body</h3>\n<p class=\"body\">\nEverything started on a brisk sunday morning in November. I was born on an Air-force base near Davis CA to a Methodist military father and a Jewish former-marketing agent mother. My father and mother met many years prior while working at their previous jobs as a bartender and waitress respectively.\n<p>After a brief 2 year stint living in Davis, my family moved to Minnesota where my younger brother was born. I don't remember much of Minnesota, save the cold and barren landscape, but I feel a strange lingering sense of nastoglia every time I watch Fargo.</p>\n<p>Not long after my brother was born, we moved again to San Antonio, TX. Here we would remain for much of my youth.</p>\n</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":"/writing/about-me","date":"2020-26-12"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/writing/about-me"}}
