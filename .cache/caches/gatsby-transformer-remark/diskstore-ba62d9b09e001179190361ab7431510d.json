As the shindig cracks down, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (played by Tommy Lee Jones) follows a day late and a dollar short in the tracks of Chigurh. While relatively distant from the main play and action, what Tommy's character lacks in punctuality, he more than makes up for in spectacular monologues and comforting old-man camera stares.</p>\n<h3>Unsolicited Opinion</h3>\n<p>Even without the A-list crew backing this movie, it <em>still</em> would probably be one of my favorite's of all time. Every character is memorable, each so fully developed I feel like I watched 3 movies instead of 1. The story is fluid and well connected with each piece playing a more vital part than the last up until the inevitable climax hotel meet-and-greet.</p>"}
