Fire up your motivation (remind yourself why you are meditating, what you want to get out of this session)\n2. Set reasonable goals\n3. Beware of expectations (relish any accomplishment and remember there is no such thing as a \"bad\" meditation session).\n4. Practice diligently (don't just daydream or plan)\n5. Review potential distractions\n6. Adjust your posture\n* To begin: Focus on any sensation within the space -> focus only on body sensations -> focus on breath sensations -> focus only on the sensations around the nose.\n* Must continue to stay present, here and now. Don't focus on future tasks, etc.\n* Focus particularly on pleasant sensations\n* To deal with thoughts: let it come, let it be, let it go.\n* meditation object is the <strong>sensation of the breath</strong> not the breath itself.\n* You can try silently counting the breaths if you are having trouble focusing on breathing. Follow the breath sensation for 10 breaths. Beginning of the out breath is the start of the cycle. </p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Personal notes and commentary</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The mind is truly ones greatest prison. If you believe that objects are the projections of our perception, then a lack of perception from the mind is the only true prison.</li>\n</ul>"}
