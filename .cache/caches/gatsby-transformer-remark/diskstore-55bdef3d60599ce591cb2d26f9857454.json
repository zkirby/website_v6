Which is exactly what I did for the 3 years between being a gymnast and realizing I should probably get my act together at school (another area I was not doing particularly well on). Middle School became a highlight for me after I left gymnastics. With relatively few commitments on my plate now I was essentially free to do nothing. And nothing is what I did. Academically I had essentially resorted to cheating off my best friend for every test on account of that's what I did when I was gymnast and didn't have time to study and hadn't developed any real study habits now that I had quit. Then, everything changed. My best friend moved to NorCal which a) left me devastated emotionally and b) made me realize I should get-my-shit-together. I clawed my way through the rest of middle school, devoting a lot of time to developing the study habits I had otherwise neglected.
