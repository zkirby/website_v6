The reporter unveils his vast knowledge of the habits, empire, and crimes of Pearson and gang through the telling of a screenplay he's written about them.</p>\n<h3>Thoughts</h3>\n<p>The dry British humor mixed with a toned down McConaughey-esque McConaughey character make for quite an entertaining film. I personally felt there were one too many visual inconsistencies and one too many glossed over character arcs to really 'get into it', but all in all I would say worth a shot. Also the 'Jungle' narrative felt in poor taste considering this film is essentially the domination of American imperialism over an Asian foreign entity.</p>"}
