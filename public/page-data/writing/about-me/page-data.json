The web is naturally impersonal relative to face to face communication and there's something intriguing about getting to know people in general. Maybe it's just some subcouncious stalker tendency I've developed - but as a child of the social media age it's probably only natural. So, dear stalker, I wanted to carve out a nice section of my own little slice of the world wide web to just sit down and talk a little more about myself. If that's something you are interested in - please read on. Otherwise, no harm no foul, maybe we'll meet in person one day for a much less one-sided introduction.\n</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Body</h2>\n<h4>Timeline</h4>\n<p class=\"body\">\nEverything started on an otherwise un-notable sunday morning in early November. I was born on an Air-force base near Davis CA to a Methodist father raining from the great state of Nebraska and a Jewish mother originally from NY but more colorado based than anything. They\n<p>After a brief 2 year stint living in Davis, my family moved to Minnesota. Those of you familar with the lifestyle of Military families will recognize, correctly, that this is likely not our last move. I don't remember much of Minnesota, save the cold and snowy landscape, but I do feel a strange fabricated sense of nastoglia every time I watch Fargo. Save for my brother being born, Minnesota was an otherwise uneventful time in my life.</p>\n<p>Just as soon as we had arrived, we were packing our bags for another move - this time to radically warmer climate. We landed in San Antonio, TX in a relatively small county outside of the city. Here we would spend much of my early youth. The most significant aspect of my life was the competitive gymnastic career I began here that would have a relatively large impact on the rest of my life. Outside of sports I was a relatively shy and quiet elementary schooler. I wasn't particularly smart or gifted, nor did I have the swave and confidence necessary to be a 'cool' kid.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Family Background</h4>\n<h4>Hobbies</h4>\n<h4>Current life</h4>\n<hr>\n<h2>Parting thoughts</h2>","frontmatter":{"slug":"/writing/about-me","date":"2020-26-12"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/writing/about-me"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
