## The Gentleman

### Should watch

- If you're craving a lil gravely McConaughey but not the Dallas Buyers Club McConaughey, more like Sahara McConaughey.
- If in the mood for a "somehow I'm rooting for the criminal and their moral superiority even though they are a ruthless drug kingpin".
- A cold glass of bourbon on a warm summer night, but not so warm as to be uncomfortable, more like warm where you can let in a nice breeze.
- You like twists where somehow the 'good guys' are infinitely smarter than quite literally everyone else around them and always wind up with the upper hand.

### One line

A modern day British weed kingpin from America runs into trouble after he decides it's time for retirement.

### Summary:

The premise of the movie is told to us from the living room of Micheal Pearson's (said Kingpin, played by Matthew McConaughey) right hand man by a reporter asking for 20 mil in exchange for some incriminating documents. The reporter unveils his vast knowledge of the habits, empire, and crimes of Pearson and gang through the telling of a screenplay he's written about them.

### Thoughts

The dry British humor mixed with a toned down McConaughey-esque McConaughey character make for quite an entertaining film. I personally felt there were one too many visual inconsistencies and one too many glossed over character arcs to really 'get into it', but all in all I would say worth a shot. Also the 'Jungle' narrative felt in poor taste considering this film is essentially the domination of American imperialism over an Asian foreign entity.
