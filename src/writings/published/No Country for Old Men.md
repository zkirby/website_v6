## No Country for Old Men

### Should watch

- Craving well developed villains, or just well developed character in general
- You're thinking of moving to the deep South and want, what I can only assume to be, and accurate portrayal of daily life.
- In a somber mood, looking for something rough, rustic, gritty, methodical, slow, yet exhilarating.
- Enjoy slow, well crafted, layered dialog.

### One line

A cowboy, a sheriff, and a psychopath collide after the cowboy discovers a briefcase full of cash in the remnants of a drug cartel dealing gone wrong.

### Summary:

The 2005 book-turned movie unfolds primarily through the eyes of a pre-Thanos Josh Brolin (the cowboy Llewelyn Moss) as he attempts to out run, out wit, and eventually out fight the methodical and cold blooded psychopath, Anton Chigurh (played by Javier Bardem) chasing after the money he recovered. As the shindig cracks down, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (played by Tommy Lee Jones) follows a day late and a dollar short in the tracks of Chigurh. While relatively distant from the main play and action, what Tommy's character lacks in punctuality, he more than makes up for in spectacular monologues and comforting old-man camera stares.

### Unsolicited Opinion

Even without the A-list crew backing this movie, it _still_ would probably be one of my favorite's of all time. Every character is memorable, each so fully developed I feel like I watched 3 movies instead of 1. The story is fluid and well connected with each piece playing a more vital part than the last up until the inevitable climax hotel meet-and-greet.
