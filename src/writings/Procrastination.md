### Notes
* Procrastination: Is the gap between intention and action. When you say or plan to do something versus when you actually end up doing it. 
	* Thought: Maybe try viewing how often tasks get punted. Refuse to punt certain tasks after an appropriate time frame.
* "At its core procrastination is a deeply existential issue with not getting on with life itself". 
* Do you have some control over you life, some sense of agency.
* It's not a time management issue. Giving a new app or agenda will not help.
* Make use of the smallest bits of time to get things done. It's a necessity
* It's the weakness of will. Self-regulation failure.
* The higher the emotional intelligence, the lower the procrastination
* If you've achieved your identity, you will be less likely to procrastinate 
* "When I think about things concretely they belong to today, when I think about things abstractly they belong to tomorrow".
	* Break it down. The more concretely the more urgent your brain thinks it is.
* We don't work under pressure, that's false, has been proven many times.
* Mindfulness mediation helps with concentration. 
* "In situation X, I will do behaviour Y to achieve sub goal Z".
