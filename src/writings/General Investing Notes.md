# General Investing Notes
*Kind of a catch all for any other investing notes that don't have a good place to be put*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Definitions
* Free Cash Flow (FCF): The amount of cash left over after all operating expenses and business investments (similar to profit)

### Notes
* Capital-efficient companies are best to invest in. How to find them:
	* Have reasonably large market caps
	* High returns on assets
	* Produce large amounts of free cash flow (FCF) in relation to the revenue they generate.
	* Consistently reward shareholders with dividends.
	* Grow revenue year after year.
