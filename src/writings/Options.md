------------------------------------------------------

### Definitions
* Options: Give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying stock at a per-determined price (called the strike price). 
* LEAPS: longer-term option contracts. Called long term equity anticipation securities. Can have expiration dates up to three years from the listing.

### Notes
* options are financial derivates, meaning that they derive their value from the underlying security or stock. 
* Have a cost associated with them, called a premium, and an expiration date. 
* When you sell options, you create a security that didn't exist before - called writing an option. 

### Calls
* profitable when the strike price is below the stock's market price (since the trader can buy the stock at a lower price).

### Puts
* profitable when the strike price is higher than the stock's market price (sine the trader can sell the stock at a higher price).
