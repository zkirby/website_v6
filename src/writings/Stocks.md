# Stocks
*general information about stocks*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Definitions 
* Stock: (also known as an equity) is a security that represents the ownership of a fraction of a corporation. Units of stock are called shares.
* Outstanding shares: a company's stock currently held by all its shareholders, including share blocks held by institutional investors and restricted shares owned by people in the company. Called "capital stock" on the balance sheet.
* Separation of ownership and control: Idea that shareholders don't really own a part of the corporation, they just own shares. You couldn't walk out with an office chair simply because you are a shareholder. 
* Retained Earnings: earnings reinvested back into the company rather than given to the shareholders (in the form of dividends).
* Common stock: can vote during shareholders meetings and receive dividends
* Preferred stocks: no voting rights but have a higher claim on assets and earnings (this is what say a CEO would receive). Also receive dividends before the common stock.

### Notes
* Two main types of stock: common and preferred. 
* Have historically out preformed most other investments over the long run.
* Corporations are treated as people by the law. They own assets, can be sued, file taxes, etc. 
* Companies issue shares in the primary market and people buy them from each other in the secondary market.
* Bondholders are entitled to interest payments and repayment of principal. Creditors get priority in the case of a bankruptcy. Much safer investment than stocks but less rewarding.
