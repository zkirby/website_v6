## Notes
### The Mind Illuminated (John Yates) 
* Materialistic reductionism: States that there is only matter, and the mind is simply a property of organizing sufficiently sophisticated matter
* Idealism: reality is indistinguishable or inseparable from human perception and/or understanding, or otherwise closely connected to ideas.
* Non-duality: A transcendental approach to cognition, there is no I-other, just 'one thing'. 
* Know Thy Self: To live life consciously and creatively as a work of art, we need to understand the raw material we have to work with.
* Meditative Absorption: Both attention and mindfulness are refined.
* Samatha: tranquility or calm
	-> Work with stable attention and mindfulness until joy emerges.
* Vipassana: Insight
* Samadhi: Concentration or stable attention
* Sati: Mindfulness
* Samadhi and Sati -> Vipassana + Samatha -> Awakening
* Need both stable attention and mindfulness to achieve vipassana and samatha.

**Stage One: Establishing a practice**
	* Maintain a consistent and daily schedule.
	* Maintain diligence - a clear sighted practice rather than daydreaming or planning.
	* All meditation really is is holding and creating conscious intentions.
	* Attention: main center field of view
	* Awareness: peripheral field of cognition
	* How to meditate: page 55
	* Trying to achieve stable attention: the ability to direct and sustain attention and control the scope of it. 
	* Mindfulness is the optimal interaction between attention and peripheral awareness. 
	* Goals of stage one: 1) prepare yourself for meditation and 2) establish a daily practice.
	* The foundation for your entire meditation career.
	* Practice the six point preparation:
		1. Fire up your motivation (remind yourself why you are meditating, what you want to get out of this session) 
		2. Set reasonable goals
		3. Beware of expectations (relish any accomplishment and remember there is no such thing as a "bad" meditation session).
		4. Practice diligently (don't just daydream or plan) 
		5. Review potential distractions
		6. Adjust your posture
	* To begin: Focus on any sensation within the space -> focus only on body sensations -> focus on breath sensations -> focus only on the sensations around the nose. 
		* Must continue to stay present, here and now. Don't focus on future tasks, etc. 
		* Focus particularly on pleasant sensations 
	* To deal with thoughts: let it come, let it be, let it go. 
	* meditation object is the **sensation of the breath** not the breath itself.
	* You can try silently counting the breaths if you are having trouble focusing on breathing. Follow the breath sensation for 10 breaths. Beginning of the out breath is the start of the cycle.

## Personal notes and commentary
* The mind is truly ones greatest prison. If you believe that objects are the projections of our perception, then a lack of perception from the mind is the only true prison.
