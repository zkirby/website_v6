* https://css-tricks.com/a-couple-of-use-cases-for-calc/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Calc()
* allows for mixing and matching of values (not possible in pre-processors). Can add percent, em, px, etc

### attr() 
* can grab any element on the actual html element and use it in the css

### Transform()
* scale() = size of element
* skewX/Y() = titls an element to the left or the right.
* perspective() = effects all descendent elements' 3D transforms, allowing them all to have a consistent depth perspective.
* These are hardware accelerated - unlike, position: absolute and other css properties.

### CSS best practices 
* Have a CSS table of contents (just a few comments in the file about which css selectors are for which elements and what not)
* Use a CSS reset 
* Put CSS3 animations last in the spreadsheet
* Using comments
