# Hello There.

## Preface

<p class="preface">
I'm often drawn to the 'about' sections of people's websites. The web is naturally impersonal relative to face to face communication and there's something intriguing about getting to know people through what they choose to show via their web persona. Maybe it's just some subconscious tendency I've developed as a child of the social media age. Maybe it's []. More than likely it's just a preference. Nonetheless, since it's something I enjoy I wanted to carve out a nice section of my own little slice of the world wide web to talk a little more about myself. If that's something you are interested in - please read on. Otherwise, no harm no foul, maybe we'll meet in person one day for a much less one-sided introduction. I certainly hope so.

## Me

#### A Timeline

A brief outline of all the various states of my life, roughly defined by the cities I've lived in. Having grown up in a military family, I've moved more times than most people my age. In my youth I considered these moves an unfortunate circumstance, but in adulthood I've grown to become extremely thankful for them. Living in the deeply conservative south TX to the extremely liberal Berkeley campus has afforded perspective and open-minded-by-default nature that has kind of come to define me as an individual.

- NorCal - 2 years.
  - I started my journey on rocket ship earth somewhere on an air force base in NorCal. I don't remember much of my time there, other than one oddly specific memory of eating Zachary's Pizza for the first time. Quite delicious - I recommend the spinach and mushroom.
- Minnesota - 2 years.
  - Having grown too fond of warm, beautiful, sunny weather and scrumptious pizza, my parents set out to explore the great winter tundra that is Minnesota. I, again, have little recollection of this time period of my life, other than it was very cold, the snow was often above eye-level, and my one and only sibling was born.
- San Antonio, TX - 7 years.
  - Seeing as they'd had enough of the extreme cold, my folks decided they wanted to experience the polar opposite. And oh did TX deliver. This is really the first part of my life that I have significant memories of. My memories of TX are mostly fond - yet I distinctly remember being excited to leave. If you've never been I highly recommend, San Antonio is actually one of the more vibrant and diverse parts of the state and there are a variety of amusements and landmarks from the River Walk to the Alamo that rival anything I've seen in other states. As for me personally, the most important thing I did in TX was start my 12 year long competitive gymnastics career that would go on to shape my drive and work ethic well into adulthood (most gyms require even the youngest of competitors to attend practices 3/4hrs everyday and 6hrs on Saturdays). Here I had absolutely no idea what I wanted life to be about. Other than gymnastics, which I wasn't particularly good at, I had no ambitions and was actually quite a poor student.
- Murrieta, CA - 8 years
  - My last stop before college was the sunny bedroom community of Murrieta CA often referred to by me and my friends as Nothing-to-do-Murrieta (TM). Located about an hour north of SD, 2 hours south of LA, and another 1 and a half inland, Murrieta manages to be a safe and secure distance from anything of entertainment. In summary, Murrieta is a pleasantly boring place. I apologize if that offends any of my fellow Inland-Empirains, but that's just the cold hard truth baby. Although, seeing as Murrieta is the place I've lived the longest thus far, it does hold a special place in my heart. Murrieta is home to some of my favorite people and friends and I am grateful for the relative quiet serenity it provides when I visit in comparison to the cities.
  - Here in Murrieta is really where I began to explore, even more so than Texas, who I wanted to be as a person. After coming to terms with the fact that I was never going to be a great - or even good - gymnast (I'm not ashamed, I just didn't have the gusto) I left a 12 year long career and set sail for planet Chillin. Which is exactly what I did for the 3 years between being a gymnast and realizing I should probably get my act together at school (another area I was not doing particularly well on). Middle School became a highlight for me after I left gymnastics. With relatively few commitments on my plate now I was essentially free to do nothing. And nothing is what I did. Academically I had essentially resorted to cheating off my best friend for every test on account of that's what I did when I was gymnast and didn't have time to study and hadn't developed any real study habits now that I had quit. Then, everything changed. My best friend moved to NorCal which a) left me devastated emotionally and b) made me realize I should get-my-shit-together. I clawed my way through the rest of middle school, devoting a lot of time to developing the study habits I had otherwise neglected. And, since study habits are really the crux of academia in most middle-American primary education and I was privileged enough to not have to worry about the many systemic issues that plague minority/lower income primary education, I was able to quickly Do-Pretty-Good (TM) in school.
  - Entering High school I was fully enveloped in the Do-Pretty-Good community which in any white suburban middle America high school put me square in with the Jocks. Or maybe it was the Nerds. One of the two. Here my passion for getting a good education so I could be a particularly well paid cog in the corporate machine really flourished. I pushed myself harder than I ever have and hopefully will. This period of time is perhaps, to this date, my greatest regret in life. Weekends spent grinding material I would forget by next semester, summers spent parading around the usual looks-good-on-a-college-app circus, hours and hours spent in after school extra-curricular that just checked a box on a college app. In essence, I was only able to smoke weed a hand-full of times, and for that I am eternally regretful.
  - The ball of anxiety I had created through social and personal pressure exploded and I began a loosing battle with an eating disorder I had been struggling with my whole life. I'm not particularly fond of talking about this period and I save you the details but I encourage you to pursue therapy. Even if you don't think you need it. It's absolutely nothing to be ashamed of and if you find someone you can connect with - it works.
  - Around senior year things started to look a lot better. It was around this time my Uncle (who's a writer) introduced me to a hobby of his - Robotics. From there I became incredibly interested in computer science and decided this was what I wanted to ultimately pursue. A few adjustments to the 'ol resume to make it seem like this was and had always been my life passion and I was good to go in the eyes of the finest state school in California.
- Berkeley, CA - 4 years
  - Like I said earlier, by mid-high school I knew what I wanted to do and who I wanted to be. College in my mind was just an execution of that vision - like an inevitable consequence of all my past actions set in motion.

So there it is, a both typical and a-typical suburban life.

#### Now

I wanted to carve out space for this mostly because I always enjoy hearing/reading about other people's hobbies, but also because I think it's important to dedicate space to something other than the usual humdrum of work life you see so often on 'personal' websites. Below are the hobbies and post-work activities I've been dedicating the most amount of time to as of this writing.

- _Cinema_: Movies have been always been a huge part of my life and at one point I thought they would be my life pursuit (I now have a 3/4 finished film major for my efforts). I enjoy all aspects of film from production to theory but I spend most of my free time watching, discussing, and writing about them.
- Language Learning: Towards the end of college, I enrolled in an introductory Chinese language class in order to fulfill part of the Film Major requirements. 2 years later I've not only continued my interest in learning Mandarin Chinese, but have begun learning other languages as well.
