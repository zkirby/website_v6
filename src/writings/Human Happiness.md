### Human happiness in the workplace
* Our modern conception of success = happiness is completely backwards
* Turns out that happiness = success. People that are happier have been proven to perform significantly better than when stressed or unhappy.
* Dopamine also turns on the learning centers for your brain, making you be able to learn better.
* Hedonic treadmill: the never ending quest for happiness via success. Relentless and unforgiving. 

### How to rewire your brain to become happier
* If you do these five things over the course of 21 days, you will become happier. You will rewire your brain to embrace happiness
	1. Write down three new things that you are grateful for
	2. Journaling about one positive experience that you've had over the past 24 hours.
	3. Exercise for 10 minutes a day.
	4. Two minutes each day to pause, think of nothing else but to just focus on your breathing.
	5. Send one positive email or message to someone praising them. 

### Lecture from Dr. Seligman
* For marriage, when your spouse brings home good news, you want to participate in active constructive. This means helping them relive the moment by asking them about what it was like to get the promotion, how it made them feel. Rather than just saying "congrats".
