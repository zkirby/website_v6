# How to lose productivity with productivity tools
Mr. Elliot Chikofsky - University of Boston.

### Definitions
* CASE: computer aided systems engineering tools - the idea of computer programs helping you to write other computer programs

### Notes
* Takes 15 to 20 years for a new technology to reach sufficient maturity for general use.
* Tool finder role - someone who goes around and finds the right tools for their company to help with productivity.
  * Fail to assign responsibility to an individual to actually make the tool useful, they just buy it.
  * They throw tools over the transom: i.e., they buy tools without ensuring that the intended developers actually need them.
* Another blocker for success is "Acquisition Deadlock" wherein an organization tries to examine every possible productivity tool without realizing that the tool itself is less important than the adaptation of its use in the organization. When a new tool is, inevitably, introduced into the market the org now has to re-analyze every tool.
* Organizations think teachings and trainings are adequate ways to learn a tool. Instead these are where the capabilities of the tool are exposed, not how to use them. That can only be learned through repeated use and customization.
* Productivity is incorrectly interpreted to be efficiency - building it faster, when the real goal is effectiveness - building the right thing better. 
* The learning curve gets repeatedly paid for when there are no means to ramp up individuals or teach them how to actually use and get the most from the productivity tool.
